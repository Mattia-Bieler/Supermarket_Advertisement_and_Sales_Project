# Supermarket Advertisement and Sales Project
## Project Background 
The intention behind this project is to explore, answer and provide suggestions for further analysis for 2Market’s business problem: its difficulty in understanding its customers. In particular, the customer demographics, the effectiveness of different advertising channels, its best-selling products and whether these products differ based on demographics. Using the ‘5 Whys’ framework, this business problem results from the neglect of strengthening a data-driven decision-making culture within 2Market. I will also explore what the average spend per country is, and how customer’s education affects social media effectiveness and product popularity. 

## Analytical Approach
The only spelling mistakes of the Excel marketing_data file were the column headings, which I did not change, as they corresponded with the metadata. Furthermore, no blanks cells or errors existed in the dataset, which I checked for using the ‘Find & Sort’ option and ‘Conditional Formatting’. To check the data type of each column, I used the TYPE function. The ‘Income’ and ‘Dt_Customer’ columns had the incorrect data type. For ‘Income’, I removed the ‘$’ sign using ‘Find & Replace’ and then changed the format from ‘General’ to ‘Currency’. For ‘Dt_Customer’, I used the ‘Text to Columns’ option twice, as some dates were in mm-dd-yyyy format while others were in dd-mm-yyyy format. I also checked for duplicates using ‘Conditional Formatting’. Although it seemed like some rows could be duplicates, all ID numbers were unique. Therefore, I did not remove any data. Finally, I merged the marital status ‘Alone’ into ‘Single’ using ‘Find & Replace’, as they mean the same thing. 

The formula, =YEAR(NOW())-[@[Year_Birth]], generated the customer ages. However, as customer registrations are only between 2012-2014, calculating the age from the current year might be incorrect. Using a pivot table and bar chart, I was able to calculate and present the overall average age (53) and each marital statuses average age. Three customers had an uncommon age of over 120. As these ages did not impact the average age, I did not filter out these customers. However, I filtered out ‘YOLO’ and ‘Absurd’, as these marital statuses do not make sense. Surprisingly, ‘Divorced’, ‘Married’, ‘Single’ and ‘Together’ had average ages within a range of six years (50-56), illustrating that age is not a significant factor for marital status. Creating two pivot tables and scatterplots, I was able to present the relationship between age and income in general, and more specifically for customers earning between $90,000-$100,000. I temporarily filtered out four visible outliers from the first scatterplot, as they made it difficult to analyse the graph. Adding a trendline to both scatterplots showed a slight income increase as age increases. 

As I imported the cleaned marketing_data Excel file, no cleaning of the data was needed in SQL. For the ad_data CSV file, I simply used syntaxes to check for ‘NULL’ values and duplicates, which did not exist. To combine both files, I used ‘JOIN’ in my syntaxes. The syntaxes I used to explore the data and answer the questions can be found above. One thing that I noticed is a correlation between total spend per product per country and the number of successful social media conversions.
